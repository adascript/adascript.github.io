my replacement [seeeduino lite](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3228) came today. i gave soldering it a shot and i, mercifully, did it right this time.

i've been trying different techniques with the solder, and i haven't found something that's _just right_, but i think i'm getting close. a couple of the joints have that cone look, but others look like blobs. i didn't have to desolder anything, though, so i'm improving. [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/making-a-good-solder-joint) is the guide i'm using, along with some various youtube videos.

title: will solder for food
---

<p>okay, i don’t think anyone would give me food for the quality of soldering i do, but i enjoy doing it.</p>

<p>unfortunately, i learned today that soldering when you have developed a light tremor is a little challenging.</p>

        it had no idea how badly i was about to solder it. also pictured: ice cream from <a href="http://ilovememphisblog.com/2012/02/have-a-paleta-at-la-michoacana/">la michoacana</a>.

        yeah ... that's not great. surprisingly there is no bridging, but it's not going to win any awards.

<p>what’s my plan for this little LCD? i kind of forget. i think i wanted to display infrared remote signal codes on it, but then i realized i could just print them to the serial monitor.</p>

<p>after checking out what each button’s value was, i mapped it to the button’s label using an array (the index corresponds to the code # that is sent) and adapted a sketch by ladyada to control a servo motor with the IR remote. it’s incredibly basic in that it only does three things right now, but i’m pretty excited about it nonetheless.</p>

<p>it’s not the best code, but it turned out better than my soldering.</p>
